# Project - News Search

# Description:
This was a small project to connect to The Guardian API and displaying the titles with corresponding links to articles.

I have added some additional styling to practice CSS.

Looking to expand on the search by adding filters and increasing the number of articles return (currently 10 max)

# Built with:

Ruby/ Rails
